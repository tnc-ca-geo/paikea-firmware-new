/*
 * Creating messages for the Scout system. We are using the first letter to
 * distinguish between firmware and message versions. Currently P denotes the
 * old message format that was created by Matt Arcidy and that will work
 * interchangibly with the MicroPython firmware. In the future we will create
 * a new, struct based format with more system feedback.
 *
 * The parsing class is a translater between system state and messages.
